# WildAlert — Project Status

_Last updated: 2026-09-15. Companion to [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md): ROADMAP is the plan,
this is where we actually are. Work proceeds one reviewable slice at a time._

## What it is
Hunter forwards a trail-cam email → we recognize the animal (mostly B/W infrared night
photos) → text the hunter the species via SMS. Event-driven microservices: Kotlin/Spring Boot
+ one Python recognition service. Dual goal: ship cheap & scalable, and learn
Kotlin/Spring/microservices.

## Architecture
```
Email → [Email Ingestion (Kotlin)] --ImageReceived--> [Kafka]
             → [Recognition (Python/DeepFaune)] --AnimalRecognized--> [Kafka]
                  → [Notification (Kotlin)] → SMS (Twilio)
        [User/Account (Kotlin)] — email→phone mapping, shared Postgres
```

## Done
- **Phase 0 — Foundations:** monorepo, Gradle Kotlin DSL multi-module, `compose.yml`
  (Postgres + Kafka + Kafka UI), README, `.env.example`.
- **Phase 1 — User/Account:** `Hunter` entity, Flyway migration, register/get/update
  endpoints, lookup-by-email (`GET /api/hunters/by-email`), email normalization
  (lowercase/trim), validation, tests.
- **Phase 2 — Notification (SMS):** `SmsSender` interface + `TwilioSmsSender` (real) /
  `LoggingSmsSender` (fake default), controller, tests.
- **Phase 3 — Email Ingestion:** MIME parser; image storage (`ImageStore` → R2 real /
  logging fake); sender→hunter matching via `HunterLookupClient` (Spring RestClient);
  `ImageReceived` event via `EventPublisher` (logging fake / Kafka). Tested.
- **Phase 4 — Recognition (Python/FastAPI):** `/health`, `/recognize`
  (`{species, confidence, low_confidence}`), confidence-threshold safeguard, DeepFaune wired
  in behind a `Classifier` interface (MegaDetector→crop→DeepFaune), CPU Docker image with
  weights baked in, plus bake-off tooling. Verified end-to-end on real photos.

## In progress — Phase 5 (Kafka wiring)
- **Slice 1 (done):** email-ingestion `KafkaEventPublisher` publishes `ImageReceived` (JSON)
  to topic `image.received`. Unit-tested; verified with a real broker round-trip.
- **Slice 2 (done):** image fetch by storage key. email-ingestion
  `FileSystemImageStore` (`storage.provider=filesystem`, writes `<root>/<key>`); recognition
  `ImageSource` (`LocalFolderImageSource` / `R2ImageSource` via boto3, chosen by
  `RECOGNITION_IMAGE_SOURCE`). Tested both sides; verified a key written by the running
  email-ingestion app reads back byte-identical from Python.
- **Slice 3 (done, pending review):** recognition Kafka worker (`python -m app.worker`, same
  image as the API). `events.py` (ImageReceived / AnimalRecognized contracts, camelCase JSON),
  transport-free `handler.handle(event)`, `worker.py` Kafka adapter (confluent-kafka).
  At-least-once: commit only after the result is delivered; invalid/missing-image messages
  skipped; other failures stop without committing. Verified in WSL with the real DeepFaune
  image + broker: boar → `wild boar` 1.00; mouflon → `fallow deer` 0.65 flagged
  `lowConfidence` (threshold caught a misclassification); bad messages skipped; LAG 0; restart
  reprocessed nothing.
- **Slice 4 (done, pending review):** notification consumes `animal.recognized`
  (`AnimalRecognizedListener`, Spring Kafka, on with `events.provider=kafka`) →
  `HunterClient` (`GET /api/hunters/{id}`) → `SmsPolicy` → `SmsSender`. Policy: one SMS per
  photo; confident → "WildAlert: wild boar detected (99% confidence)"; low confidence → hedged
  "animal detected, species uncertain (maybe fallow deer)"; unknown sender / deleted / inactive
  hunter → no SMS; English. user-account outage is thrown (retried by Spring Kafka's default
  error handler, then skipped). Added `services/notification/Dockerfile` + root `.dockerignore`.
  Verified full chain in WSL (ImageReceived → DeepFaune worker → notification → fake SMS) with
  real user-account + Postgres: all 6 cases correct, LAG 0.
- **Slice 5 (done):** per-hunter inbound address. user-account: Flyway V2
  `inbound_token` (backfilled for existing hunters), `InboundAddresses` (token@
  `INBOUND_EMAIL_DOMAIN`, 12 unambiguous chars), `inboundAddress` in responses,
  `GET /api/hunters/by-inbound-address`. email-ingestion: matches the hunter by recipient —
  `?envelopeTo=` (webhook), then `Delivered-To`/`X-Original-To`/`To`/`Cc`; `From` matching
  dropped (spoofable); `matchedRecipient` in the response; added `Dockerfile`.
  **Verified true end-to-end from raw emails in WSL** (email-ingestion → filesystem + Kafka →
  DeepFaune worker → notification → fake SMS): auto-forwarded email (From camera, To hunter's
  Gmail, Delivered-To inbound) → SMS "wild boar"; camera-direct via envelopeTo → hedged SMS;
  spoofed From → no match, no SMS. Migration applied to a DB with existing hunters: all got
  distinct tokens.
- **Slice 6 (done, pending review):** no double SMS on redelivery. notification gained a
  `ProcessedEvents` interface — `InMemoryProcessedEvents` (fake default, per-instance) and
  `PostgresProcessedEvents` (`IDEMPOTENCY_STORE=postgres`, Flyway V1 `notification.processed_event`
  in its own schema so it doesn't clash with user-account's Flyway history). `NotificationService`
  **claims** `sourceEventId` before sending (`insert … on conflict do nothing`, so racing replicas
  can't both send) and **releases** it if the send throws, so a failed send is still retried.
  `DataSourceAutoConfiguration` is excluded, so the service still starts with no database.
- **Slice 7 (done, pending review):** retries + dead-letter topics, closing Phase 5. Both
  consumers now park what they can't process in `<topic>.dlt` (original bytes + key, reason in a
  header) and commit, so nothing is lost and one bad message can't block a partition.
  - **Python worker:** unprocessable messages (invalid JSON, missing image) are dead-lettered
    immediately; other failures get 3 attempts with a growing pause, then the DLT. Only a failure
    to reach Kafka is raised (no commit → retried after restart).
  - **Notification (Kotlin):** `DefaultErrorHandler` + `DeadLetterPublishingRecoverer`, 3 attempts
    2s apart, `HttpClientErrorException` treated as not retryable. Replaces Spring's default of
    retrying fast and then silently dropping the alert.
  - **Verified in WSL:** with user-account stopped, a valid result ended up in
    `animal.recognized.dlt`; an `ImageReceived` pointing at a missing image ended up in
    `image.received.dlt` with `reason:No image stored under key …`. Both consumer groups ended at
    LAG 0. _Not directly observed: the retry count/timing — only that the handler gave up and
    dead-lettered._
  - **Known trade-off:** a long storage outage would push a backlog into the DLT rather than
    waiting it out. A replay tool for the DLT is a Phase 7 job.

## Remaining phases
- **6 — Deploy** to managed cloud (Cloud Run + managed Postgres + managed Kafka/Pub-Sub + R2
  + Cloudflare Email Routing).
- **7 — Hardening & cost control** (tune threshold, smart-SMS to cut cost, logging/metrics,
  admin auth).
- **8 — React frontend.**
- **9 — Scale / auth / billing.**

## Key decisions
- **Recognition model = DeepFaune** (not SpeciesNet) — targets European animals; chosen via a
  bake-off on real photos (DeepFaune gave specific species; SpeciesNet gave vague
  families/global bias). Both are free/open, self-hosted.
- **Broker-agnostic events** (JSON) so Kafka local ↔ managed Kafka **or** Cloud Pub/Sub in
  prod is a config/impl swap. Pub/Sub free tier is the likely cheapest prod option on GCP.
- **Swappable-interface pattern everywhere:** `ImageStore` (R2/logging), `SmsSender`
  (Twilio/logging), `EventPublisher` (kafka/logging), `Classifier` (deepfaune/stub) — fake
  default, real impl via config.
- Recognition & SMS are cheap/free; **SMS dominates cost** (~90%).

## Known gaps / follow-ups
- **Inbound email webhook not built yet:** matching by recipient is done (slice 5), but the real
  Cloudflare Email Routing → webhook (an Email Worker that POSTs the raw email with
  `?envelopeTo=<message.to>`) comes with deploy (Phase 6). Check there which headers Cloudflare
  actually adds; `envelopeTo` is the reliable path.
- **user-account `contextLoads` test needs Postgres running** (`docker compose up -d postgres`);
  unit/web tests don't. It passes from the Windows host once the container is up.
- **`HunterLookupClient` resilience:** only catches 404; if user-account is down, the
  ingestion webhook 500s and no event is created. Fix = also catch connection errors → treat
  as no-match (degrade gracefully). _Not yet done._
- **Recognition first-request latency:** model loads on first `/recognize` (~1 min); could
  warm at startup. (The Kafka worker already loads it at startup.)
- **Model licences — resolve before charging money:** `MegaDetectorV6("MDV6-yolov9-c")` is
  Ultralytics-based (**AGPL-3.0**, a concern for a paid network service); PyTorch-Wildlife also
  ships MIT (`megadetectorv6_mit`) and Apache (`rtdetr_apache`) MDv6 variants — swap and re-run the
  accuracy check. DeepFaune weights are **CC BY-SA 4.0** per the loader header (commercial use
  OK with attribution to CNRS/DeepFaune; confirm on deepfaune.cnrs.fr). Not legal advice — get a
  licensing check before launch.
- **Local-dev env limit (this machine):** WSL2 shuts the distro down between commands, killing
  running containers — do multi-step Docker work in one session. Port reachability is **not** a
  problem: the Windows host reaches WSL2 Docker ports fine (corrected 2026-09-17), so
  Testcontainers / host-run integration tests are worth trying.
